    "The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects:\n",

    "## 5.1.1 list.append(x)\n",
    "Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].\n",

    "Equivalent to a[len(a):] = iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1.3 list.insert(i, x)\n",
    "Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x).\n",

    "## 5.1.4 list.remove(x)\n",
    "Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a ValueError if there is no such item.\n",

    "## 5.1.5 list.pop([i])\n",
    "Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. (The square brackets around the i in the method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you should type square brackets at that position. You will see this notation frequently in the Python Library Reference.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1.6 list.clear()\n",
    "Remove all items from the list. Equivalent to del a[:].\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1.7 list.index(x[, start[, end]])\n",
    "Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is equal to x. Raises a ValueError if there is no such item.\n",
    "The start and end are optional arguments interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1.8 list.count(x)\n",
    "Return the number of times x appears in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1.9 list.sort(key=None, reverse=False)\n",
    "Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see sorted() for their explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1.10 list.reverse()\n",
    "Reverse the elements of the list in place.\n",

    "# 5.8. Comparing Sequences and Other Types\n",
    "Sequence objects may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one. Lexicographical ordering for strings uses the Unicode code point number to order individual characters. Some examples of comparisons between sequences of the same type:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1, 2, 3)              < (1, 2, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]              < [1, 2, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "'ABC' < 'C' < 'Pascal' < 'Python'\n",
    "\n",
    "(1, 2, 3, 4)           < (1, 2, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "(1, 2)                 < (1, 2, -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "(1, 2, 3)             == (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "(1, 2, ('aa', 'ab'))   < (1, 2, ('abc', 'a'), 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that comparing objects of different types with < or > is legal provided that the objects have appropriate comparison methods. For example, mixed numeric types are compared according to their numeric value, so 0 equals 0.0, etc. Otherwise, rather than providing an arbitrary ordering, the interpreter will raise a TypeError exception."
