    "        It's created with a pair of square brackets and the values separated by commas. \n",
    "        The list is mutable, which means that you may add, delete, and change values later by calling e.g. X[0]=5. \n",
    "        \n",
    "     2- A tuple is immutable which means you can not change the values once it's been created.\n",
    "        X=(1,2,3,4,5)\n",
    "        A tuple is created using parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "     3- A dictionary is a sequence of key-value pairs. X={\"one\":1,\"two\":2,\"three\":3,\"four\":4,\"five\":5}\n",
    "         In other languages, this may be called an associative array or e.g. in Java a hashed array. \n",
    "         A dictionary is created using curly brackets. A set is an unordered list of unique values. \n",
    "         It's useful for finding and operating upon unique values within a sequence. \n",
